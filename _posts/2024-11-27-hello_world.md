Well, here we go, this is my very first post, my "_initial commit_" on a project that has been running aroung my mind for many years already.

It is funny because it all started with the idea of __"_I will create a blog to become millionaire_"__,
evolving to __"_I want to become a well known engineer that other engineers ask for help_"__,
and currently at __"_I have so many guides and tshooting notes, so let's make them public_"__.

I also strongly believe that everyone in this industry must build the habit of __documenting__ and there is no better way of developing such skill than journaling.

Since this is a introductory post and I just want to get this rolling, I'll leave it up to here.

From me to myself...
